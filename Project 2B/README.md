<h3 align="center">Indian EV Market Segmentation Analysis Report</h3>

- ðŸ”­ This 2nd Project (Market Segmentation Analysis) was to Prepare a report regarding Indian EV Market Segmentation Analysis [Indian EV Market Segmentation Analysis Report](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Feynn-Labs-Machine-Learning-Internship/blob/main/Project%202B/K_NITHINRAM___Indian_EV_Market_Segmentation_Analysis_Report.pdf). A comprehensive analysis of the Indian EV market, By considering infrastructure availability that is Public Charging Stations, consumer ratings, consumer types, EV sales across the nation, and other major variables by thoroughly evaluating various government-published datasets and open-source datasets. The report analyzes multiple segments based on data-driven approaches to uncover valuable insights for strategic decision-making for pricing and establishing EV sales on best-suited geographic locations for EV sales to maximize market attention and profitability.


## Overview
This study was part of my work during my Machine Learning internship at **Feynn Labs**. The research focuses on the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market, segmenting it based on demographics, geography, sales, and consumer behavior.

## Machine Learning Techniques Used
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Applied for dimensionality reduction to identify key variables impacting the EV market.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Utilized to discover optimal segments within the EV market, focusing on the following categories:
  - Two-Wheeler
  - Three-Wheeler
  - Four-Wheeler

## Dataset Sources
The data was gathered from reliable open-source platforms, including:
- **Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India**
- **VAHAN SEWAâ€”DASHBOARD**
- **Kaggle** (additional resources)

The datasets covered various aspects such as:
- EV sales
- Public charging station infrastructure
- Consumer ratings
- EV Details, price, and range

## Results
### Target Segments
- **Karnataka**, **Delhi**, and **Maharashtra** stood out as key regions in the categories of Two-Wheeler and Four-Wheeler EV sales.

### Consumer Focus
- Segmenting by consumer preferences and infrastructure availability highlighted that the most promising vehicle type is **Two-Wheelers**, especially in regions like Karnataka and Delhi.

### Infrastructure Insights
- The number of operational public charging stations significantly impacts market penetration, with Karnataka and Maharashtra showing highly developed EV infrastructure.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides actionable insights into the evolving Indian EV market and presents substantial opportunities, particularly in the states of **Karnataka**, **Delhi**, and **Maharashtra**. By targeting specific segments within the Two-Wheeler, Three-Wheeler, and Four-Wheeler categories identified in this study, manufacturers can effectively capture market share and meet the diverse needs of Indian consumers in the expanding Indian EV market.

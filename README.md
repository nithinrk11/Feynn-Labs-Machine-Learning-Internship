<h3 align="center">This Repo contains all of my contributions and Projects done during my role as a Machine Learning intern at Feynn Labs</h3>

- ðŸ”­ The 1st Project Assignment during my ongoing Virtual Internship at AIncubator - Feynn Labs and Feynn Labs. As part of the AI Product/Service Ideation task, I was challenged to come up with a business idea where Machine Learning/Data Science could support small or medium businesses in areas like sales, business operations, or marketing. [ReciHealth: An AI-Driven Nutritional and Health Assistant for Personalized Wellness](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Feynn-Labs-Machine-Learning-Internship/blob/main/Project1/K_Nithinram.pdf). 
With so many choices and confusing and non-transparent nutritional information, staying healthy could be overwhelming. ReciHealth offers a personalized AI-based solution to help users make informed food choices track their nutrition, and even predict health outcomes based on their daily routines and dietary habits.
- ðŸ”­ The 2nd Project (Market Segmentation Analysis) was to Prepare a report regarding Indian EV Market Segmentation Analysis [Indian EV Market Segmentation Analysis Report](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Feynn-Labs-Machine-Learning-Internship/blob/main/Project%202B/K_NITHINRAM___Indian_EV_Market_Segmentation_Analysis_Report.pdf)

- ðŸ”­ The 3rd Project (AI Product/Service Business & Financial Modelling - Final Project) is the continuation of the 1st Project where I performed a small scale code implementation for validation and business modelling and market analysis for my proposed Project idea [ReciHealth Report](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Feynn-Labs-Machine-Learning-Internship/blob/main/Project%203/ReciHealth_Report.pdf)

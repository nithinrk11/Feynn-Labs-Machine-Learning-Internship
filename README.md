<h3 align="center">This Repo contains all of my Contributions and Projects done during my role as a Machine Learning Intern at Feynn Labs</h3>

- ðŸ”­ The 1st Project  Assignment (AI Product/Service Ideation task) during my Virtual Internship at AIncubator - Feynn Labs and Feynn Labs, I was challenged to come up with a business idea where Machine Learning/Data Science could support small or medium businesses in areas like sales, business operations, or marketing. [ReciHealth: An AI-Driven Nutritional and Health Assistant for Personalized Wellness](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Feynn-Labs-Machine-Learning-Internship/blob/main/Project1/K_Nithinram.pdf). 
With so many choices and confusing and non-transparent nutritional information, staying healthy could be overwhelming. ReciHealth offers a personalized AI-based solution to help users make informed food choices track their nutrition, and even predict health outcomes based on their daily routines and dietary habits.


- ðŸ”­ The 2nd Project (Market Segmentation Analysis) was to Prepare a report regarding Indian EV Market Segmentation Analysis [Indian EV Market Segmentation Analysis Report](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Feynn-Labs-Machine-Learning-Internship/blob/main/Project%202B/K_NITHINRAM___Indian_EV_Market_Segmentation_Analysis_Report.pdf). A comprehensive analysis of the Indian EV market, By considering infrastructure availability that is Public Charging Stations, consumer ratings, consumer types, EV sales across the nation, and other major variables by thoroughly evaluating various government-published datasets and open-source datasets. The report analyzes multiple segments based on data-driven approaches to uncover valuable insights for strategic decision-making for pricing and establishing EV sales on best-suited geographic locations for EV sales to maximize market attention and profitability.


- ðŸ”­ The 3rd Project (AI Product/Service Business & Financial Modelling - Final Project) is the continuation of the 1st Project where I performed code implementation for validation and business modeling and market analysis for my proposed Project idea [ReciHealth Report](https://github.com/nithinrk11/Feynn-Labs-Machine-Learning-Internship/blob/main/Project%203/ReciHealth_Report.pdf). With scalable monetization strategies, including affiliate partnerships and in-app purchases, ReciHealth provides a solid business model as a cost-effective solution for promoting healthy living while driving long-term growth potential for startups in the health tech market.
